# Getting started

This folder contains the souce code to reproduce the experimental results reported in (Kappel et al. 2014).


The experiments were run in Matlab R2007a (7.4.0.287) on a Linux machine (Fedora, Core release 6
(Zod)).

To get started run the `run_experiment.m` script (you need writing permission on the current working
directory to seccesfully run). This will perform a whole training session and plot the results.
This experimental setup is equal to experiment 1 of [1]. The results are saved to the `results/`
subfolder of your current working directory.
